DRAFT DOCUMENT
## Minimal Command Line git
### Introduction
This documnet attempts to layout a work flow for using GitHub and Git as our version control software in this course covering HTML, CSS
and a tad of JavaScript. The original hope was that, since our results were all plain text, that we could build and maintain our work in
GitHub alone, but issues such as privacy kept raising their heads causing roadblocks in such an approach, so I surrendered and 
decided to bite the bullet and introduce as little command line Git as we could get by with. Along those lines 
[Useful Reference](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque2D/wiki/Cloning-the-repo-and-working-with-Git), I think, is a very good reference for that level and may even touch slightly on topics that we do not need here. If you view this page be sure to checkout the 
three links in the recommendations section at the bottom of the page. They may be more helpful than this initial page itself.  

As I have mentioned our requirements are minimal as far as GitHub and Git go, so I have listed in the following section the assumptions upon which the workability of the work is predicated.  
## Assumptions

1. The reader has a GitHub account and access to a private repository already defined in GitHub where the work will be kept. 
1. That repository always contains the latest frozen version of the application in the **master** branch, and
1. that a development branch has been created which I will refer to as **work**.
1. The reader is prevented from merging into the **master** branch without an approved review from an administrator of the repository.  

Briefly speaking, the work flow will go as follows:
1. The repository will copied (cloned) to a directory on a local machine.
1. There the application will be built, modified or enhanced using tools on the local machine, such as Notepad++, NetBeans, Android Studio.
1. After testing, the version of the application in the GitHub repository will be updated with with the modification, and
1. A Pull Request comparing the **master** and **work** branches will be created.
1. Following the review of the PR, the reader will either make requested changes or correction and resubmit the PR or, upon an 
accepted review, will merge the **work** branch into the **master** branch and delete the **work** branch.

### Work Flow
1. On your local machine, create a folder named, perhaps, **MyRepos**, right-click that folder and select **Git Bash**

   You should find yourself in a command line environment that is actually simulating a Unix/Linus command line. In this environment 
   you will be able to issue **git** commands. You must, however, type the word **git** before each command as indicated in the 
   work flow commands following.

1. **git config --global user.name "David Murrell"**

   Tell git your name so it can use in any commits you might use. 
   
1. **git config --global user.email "dmurrell@faulkner.edu"**

   Similarly, tell git your name for it to include in any commits. 
   
1. **git clone https://github.com/FU-CIS3360-FALL2017/javajam-coffee-house-bp90347.git**  

   Download a copy of a repository from GitHub to your local machine. The files of the downloaded repository will appear in a
   directory (folder), called the **working directory**, in the **MyRepos** folder. This folder will have the name of the download       repository. 
   
1. **git checkout work**  
   
   Ask git to provide the files of the **work** branch in the working directory.
   
1. Change or add files using local machine tools
1. Test application using local machine tools
1. **git add \*** Â 

   Ask git to add all files in the working directory that have been added or change to the git **staging** area.
   
1. **git commit -m 'commit title'**  

   Ask git to take a snapshot of the files in the staging area and place it in the **head** area. These are the file that will
   be sychronized with the **work** branch on GitHub when the **push** command is next given.
   
1. **git push origin work**

   Ask git to synchronize the files in the **head** area with the **work** branch on GitHub.
   
1. Inspect changes in GitHub
1. Create a Pull Request in GitHub
1. Respond to PR review

### Comfort Commands

1. **git remote -v**
1. **git branch -v** 
1. **git status**
1. **git log**
1. **git diff master chapter3**
1. **git pull**
